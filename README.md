# multi-objective-optimisation

Suppose we're developing a software, we have a list of requirements,
their costs and a list of customers with desired requirements ordered by wishes.
Each customer has a weight. Each requirement has a cost and score. Using a genetic algorithm
this project is trying to find solutions using NSGA2 selection.
Trying to minimise cost and maximise score.

Using the [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) Evolutionary Algorithms Python library.

## To Run:
### 1. Install [pipenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv)
```bash
$ pip install pipenv
```

### 2. cd to project directory and:
```bash
$ pipenv install
```

```bash
$ pipenv shell
```
```bash
$ python src/geneticAlgorithm.py
```
Wait for the GA to run, you'll see an [animation](https://youtu.be/xeNv6VDH004) at the end.

#### If you prefer using Anaconda:
You'll need to install [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) globally:
```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge deap
```

cd to project directory and:

```bash
$ python src/geneticAlgorithm.py
```
